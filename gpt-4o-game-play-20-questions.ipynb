    "**Historical note (not that important):** \n",
    "\n",
    "- At one point, the \"LLM 20 Questions\" competition had two categories of keywords: \"locations\" and \"things\". However, with just a few weeks left in the competition, <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198\" target=\"_blank\">the \"locations\" category was removed</a>.\n",
    "- When \"locations\" were still part of the competition, we were hardcoding the first question to be `\"Is it a proper noun?\"` to distinguish \"locations\" (proper nouns) from \"things\" (common nouns). GPT-4o's role started from the first answer, not the first question (as a consequence of hardcoding the first question).\n",
    "- In fact, the subsequent prompt used (from round 2 onwards) was different, depending on the answer to the first question - `\"no\"` (-> the keyword must be a \"thing\") / `\"yes\"` (-> the keyword must be a \"location\").\n",
    "- Our team had already generated a large amount of data (and burnt through hundreds of dollars of OpenAI credits) when this change to the competition was announced. We didn't want to throw all this data away.\n",
    "- So we came up with a hack to re-use all this data for the new scenario where there are \"things\" only (i.e., there are no \"locations\" any more). Our hack comprised of four steps: (i) delete all the game play data for \"locations\", (ii) get rid of the \"locations\" specific prompt, i.e., retain only the \"things\" specific prompt, (iii) continue the previous games for \"things\" for one more round (since the first question `\"Is it a proper noun?\"` was now pointless and redundant - making the previous games effectively \"19 questions\" instead of \"20 questions\"), and (iv) instantiate the `Game` class with the following state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.questions = [\"Is it a proper noun?\"] # This first question (for round 1) was hardcoded when \"locations\" were still part of the competition.\n",
    "self.answers = [\"no\"] # The answer to the above question for \"things\" was always \"no\".\n",
    "self.guesses = [\"common noun\"] # The most common first round guess for \"things\" was \"common noun\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this hack, the above initial state effectively became the zeroth round - a sort of redundant \"dummy round\". It meant that the \"actual start\" of the game was after this dummy round.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are starting from scratch (on \"things\" only), please **don't worry about the above hack**. Instead, feel free to use any question, answer & guess combination that you feel is appropriate for the zeroth (dummy) round. For example, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.questions = [\"Is it a thing?\"] # Example question for the zeroth (dummy) round.\n",
    "self.answers = [\"yes\"] # Example answer for the zeroth (dummy) round.\n",
    "self.guesses = [\"something\"] # Example guess for the zeroth (dummy) round.\n",
